    * Each declaration has a property name and value.
  ### CSS Selectors
  - Used to “find” HTML elements based on their element name, id, class, attribute, etc.
  ### The element Selector
  - Selects elements based on element name.
  - Ex. <p> = p
  ### The id Selector
  - Uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element
  - To select an element based on id, use # with id name.
